# Sound Vane

Air quality you can hear.

## Develop

Sound Vane uses React Typescript for its frontend and NodeJS for its backend. By default, the frontend runs on port 3000 and the backend runs on port 3001.


Clone the git repo:

`git clone https://github.com/marjo-luc/sound-vane.git`


In one terminal, start the frontend:

`npm start`


In a second terminal, start the backend:

`node server/server.js`


Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app. The page will reload as you make edits.
